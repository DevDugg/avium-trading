      content: `Just completed the Avium beta cohort mentorship by Pidgeon . Here are my thoughts:
      
          Before the mentorship, I was purely an emotional trader and copied what everyone else was doing
          
          e.g. looking at the WW newsletter and TG calls. I felt like I was always a couple steps behind and 
          
          waiting for someone to tell me what to do ü´• . Also, I did not have any TA experience.
          
          <br /><br />
          
          After the mentorship, I feel very comfortable looking at a chart and analyzing it. Though I am no TA
          
          expert by any means, but rather look forward to running TA from what I have learned from Pidgeon 
          
          and the mentorship üìâ . I often find myself referring back to the materials ie online reading and
          
          recorded videos to get reminded on what to do if I get stuck analyzing a chart.
          
          <br /><br />

          In addition, I'm grateful that the mentorship has made me realize spot/investing is a form of 
          
          trading. I originally wanted to solely trade on futures and thought that was the only way to
          
          Valhalla. This isn‚Äôt the case anymore and already incorporated gains from spot trading and looking
          
          forward to more.

          <br /><br />
          
          Lastly, the mentorship has helped me to filter out the news , larps, grifters, and twitter feed...and
          
          purely look at the charts. This has tremendously helped me keep my sanity when i see volatile
          
          changes in the market.

          <br /><br />
          
          For Pidgeon, rock solid mentor. Very knowledgeable and professional throughout the mentorship.
          
          He was always a Weekly Wizdom caller that I was trying to catch up on, and provided üíØ X more
          
          than I expected during the mentorship. Highly suggest participating in an upcoming mentorship.
          
          You won‚Äôt be disappointed, you have my word.

          <br /><br />
          
          For my fellow pupils Aber, Roigadaa, Etash, happy to have learned alongside you and hope you feel
          
          the same way above. Good luck with your journey!

      I would like to share my experience from the mentorship for the new pupils and whoever is interested or in doubt of embracing this journey.

      Before anything else I‚Äôll suggest to read this Twitter/X thread from Pidgeon on the stages of trading (Link Here)

      <br /><br />

      I went through the first stage (Uninformed Optimism) years ago, spot holding on the previous bullrun, which turned from spot holding to bagholding because ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs GonNA ComEEe BAck!!!1!‚Äù

      <br /><br />

      Then came stage 2, I was ‚Äútrying'' different strategies and following calls by some fake gurus on twitter without knowing what I was doing, then FOMOing when price pumped and not cutting my losses when price dropped, and again, still not understanding what I was looking at TA wise.

      <br /><br />

      After that, the valley of despair hit‚Ä¶ and it hit hard.

      <br /><br />

      Hearing about the Edge workshops on Twitter I got into Weekly Wizdom. What caught me during one of the workshops was Pidgeon saying that no news or event is needed for price to move because everything is already in the charts; if you are good enough to read it then the chart will tell you everything.

      <br /><br />

      With no real TA experience I decided to give it a last try and hop in the mentorship and I just wish that happened a few years ago.. But hey, there‚Äôs always another trade üòâ

      <br /><br />

      Charting/analysing a coin,stock or whatever has some PA has now become a ‚Äúfinding opportunity‚Äù activity. My confidence in my trade ideas has increased, charts are cleaner with explicit entries, take profits and exits. I get into trades if my conditions are met, otherwise I wait for price to come to me or until the chart suggests I should take action.
      
      <br /><br />

      Ashlin also shared that spot/investing is a form of trading and I totally agree with him. This is also covered during the lessons.

      <br /><br />

      The way to Success and Fulfilment (Stage 5) is still long but I'm pretty sure I‚Äôve stepped up from the valley of despair to the Informed Optimist one (Stage 4)

      <br /><br />

      For this I would like to thank Pidgeon for the tools and resources he gave tous, his view of the market, the clarity during his lesson and most importantly the patience and willingness to answer each of our doubts during the live calls, a big thanks also goes to BTC_Jay for hopping into the lessons and dropping bangers. I cannot be more happy to have both of you guys as mentors and to be a student of yours! Always learning from both of you.

      <br /><br />

      As for my fellow ‚ÄòScholars‚Äô, Ashlin, Roigadaa and Etash, I wish you all the best of luck for everything and I‚Äôm happy to have shared these 2 months with you guys."

      content: `Before the mentorship, I didn't know much about technical analysis. I used to trade based on feelings and trends in Solana shitcoins without really understanding the market. Now, I feel much more confident reading charts. When I started the mentorship, I wanted to learn to day trade perps, but it's harder to do alongside trading shitcoins, which takes up a lot of time.
      
      <br /><br />

      How I use what I learned:
      1- The technical analysis skills I gained help me find amazing entry points for trending shitcoins.
      2- I also use them for long-term investments.
      
      <br /><br />

      Pidgeon, the mentor, explains things very well and has excellent teaching abilities. Moreover, he is friendly and interesting to listen to.
      
      <br /><br />

      I wholeheartedly recommend the mentorship.

      yes ChatGPT wrote the paragraph above. I suck at writing, even in my mother tongue. It reflects 100% my opinion.

      Thx Pidgeon  for these 2 months, real pleasure.

      content: `Avium is a game changer. When I first tried my hand at trading it felt more like gambling than a learned skill.  
          I knew I was missing something. All of my big wins kept getting canceled out by even bigger losses.  I was always intimidated by TA.

          <br /><br />
          
          I thought it was a skill used only by people much smarter than me. Avium showed me I was very wrong!  Shortly after I started working with Pidgeon I was transformed into a profitable trader hitting win after win with consistency.

          <br /><br />
          
          Avium gave me a gift that I can never repay and my ROI is literally off the charts. If you want to be able to analyze charts like a pro and be a self-sufficient trader, no longer a slave to the next ‚Äúcall‚Äù in a trading group, then I highly recommend this program.

      content: `Before going through the mentorship I had very little understanding of how markets worked, how to analyze charts for patterns, how money flowed in the cryptocurrency space.

      <br /><br />
      
          I was mostly a spot buyer (still am for the most part) and didn't think it was realistic to expect to make money actively trading.
          
          <br />

          If I tried to trade something short-term it was more narrative-based rather than taking price action into account. I also wasn't as confident in my spot investments as I didn't have a good understanding of why certain investments would outperform others.

          <br /><br />

          But after learning from Pidgeon, I feel much more comfortable in long-term investing as well as short-term active trading.
          
          <br /><br />
          
          I have a better foundation now when I enter positions as I know where to look to and gather information. I mentally feel much more at ease since I now know the reasons as to why I enter and exit positions.`,

          Sensei Pidgeon's style makes it simple enough to understand but complex enough to give you an edge in the market. 
         <br /><br />
          This mentorship filled the many knowledge gaps that I was unaware of and it also helped systematize my trading plan and strategy. 
         <br /><br />
          This is NOT an online course where you're thrown into the deep end where you then proceed to drown in hours of video lectures as you struggle to stay afloat amid real-time volatile market swings.
         <br /><br />
          This is an active-learning mentorship where you are provided concise readings to stimulate Q&A engagement in the upcoming lectures. Between sessions, anonymous charts are also provided to encourage technical analysis and application of the tools we learned. 
          I cannot recommend this Mentorship enough.

          Special thanks to my cohort mates MincoDeluxe, Gcorm, Box_Robe, dmenace_1, drxgon5ly, LORD TOYNAIRE and botzelot who always carried the sessions with their interactions and timely questions. Thank you for picking up my slack
