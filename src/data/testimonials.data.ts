      content: `Just completed the Avium beta cohort mentorship by Pidgeon . Here are my thoughts:
      
          Before the mentorship, I was purely an emotional trader and copied what everyone else was doing e.g. looking at the WW newsletter and TG calls. I felt like I was always a couple steps behind and waiting for someone to tell me what to do ü´• . Also, I did not have any TA experience.
          
          After the mentorship, I feel very comfortable looking at a chart and analyzing it. Though I am no TA expert by any means, but rather look forward to running TA from what I have learned from Pidgeon and the mentorship üìâ . I often find myself referring back to the materials ie online reading and recorded videos to get reminded on what to do if I get stuck analyzing a chart. 
          
          In addition, I'm grateful that the mentorship has made me realize spot/investing is a form of trading. I originally wanted to solely trade on futures and thought that was the only way to Valhalla. This isn‚Äôt the case anymore and already incorporated gains from spot trading and looking forward to more.
          
          Lastly, the mentorship has helped me to filter out the news , larps, grifters, and twitter feed...and purely look at the charts. This has tremendously helped me keep my sanity when i see volatile changes in the market. 
          
          For Pidgeon, rock solid mentor. Very knowledgeable and professional throughout the mentorship. He was always a Weekly Wizdom caller that I was trying to catch up on, and provided üíØ X more than I expected during the mentorship. Highly suggest participating in an upcoming mentorship. You won‚Äôt be disappointed, you have my word.
          
          For my fellow pupils Aber, Roigadaa, Etash, happy to have learned alongside you and hope you feel the same way above. Good luck with your journey!

            Before anything else I‚Äôll suggest to read this Twitter/X thread from Pidgeon on the stages of trading (Link Here)
            
            I went through the first stage (Uninformed Optimism) years ago, spot holding on the previous bullrun, which turned from spot holding to bagholding because ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs GonNA ComEEe BAck!!!1!‚Äù
            
            Then came stage 2, I was ‚Äútrying'' different strategies and following calls by some fake gurus on twitter without knowing what I was doing, then FOMOing when price pumped and not cutting my losses when price dropped, and again, still not understanding what I was looking at TA wise.
            
            After that, the valley of despair hit‚Ä¶ and it hit hard.
            
            Hearing about the Edge workshops on Twitter I got into Weekly Wizdom. What caught me during one of the workshops was Pidgeon saying that no news or event is needed for price to move because everything is already in the charts; if you are good enough to read it then the chart will tell you everything.
            
            With no real TA experience I decided to give it a last try and hop in the mentorship and I just wish that happened a few years ago.. But hey, there‚Äôs always another trade üòâ
            
            Charting/analysing a coin,stock or whatever has some PA has now become a ‚Äúfinding opportunity‚Äù activity. My confidence in my trade ideas has increased, charts are cleaner with explicit entries, take profits and exits. I get into trades if my conditions are met, otherwise I wait for price to come to me or until the chart suggests I should take action.
            
            Ashlin also shared that spot/investing is a form of trading and I totally agree with him. This is also covered during the lessons.
            
            The way to Success and Fulfilment (Stage 5) is still long but I'm pretty sure I‚Äôve stepped up from the valley of despair to the Informed Optimist one (Stage 4)
            
            For this I would like to thank Pidgeon for the tools and resources he gave tous, his view of the market, the clarity during his lesson and most importantly the patience and willingness to answer each of our doubts during the live calls, a big thanks also goes to BTC_Jay for hopping into the lessons and dropping bangers. I cannot be more happy to have both of you guys as mentors and to be a student of yours! Always learning from both of you.
            
            
            As for my fellow ‚ÄòScholars‚Äô, Ashlin, Roigadaa and Etash, I wish you all the best of luck for everything and I‚Äôm happy to have shared these 2 months with you guys.`,

      content: `Before the mentorship, I didn't know much about technical analysis. I used to trade based on feelings and trends in Solana shitcoins without really understanding the market. Now, I feel much more confident reading charts. When I started the mentorship, I wanted to learn to day trade perps, but it's harder to do alongside trading shitcoins, which takes up a lot of time.
      
          How I use what I learned: 
          1- The technical analysis skills I gained help me find amazing entry points for trending shitcoins. 
          2- I also use them for long-term investments.
          
          Pidgeon, the mentor, explains things very well and has excellent teaching abilities. Moreover, he is friendly and interesting to listen to.
          
          I wholeheartedly recommend the mentorship.
