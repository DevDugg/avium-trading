      question: "How are the mentorship session conducted?",
      answer:
        "Yes. This is because the vast majority of new traders go into trading without learning first. It’s like letting a doctor operate without any training. Wouldn’t go very well would it? At Avium we provide that much needed education to help you join the 10% of winners.",

      question: "What is the difference between the Mentorship and 1-on-1 Sessions?",
      answer:
        "A few reasons, firstly, we love trading and by extension telling people about it. One of the most satisfying feelings is seeing someone win and improving their situation using the things you taught them. Secondly, there is a lot of downtime with trading, time simply spent waiting, we think it’s better to fill that time with something productive.",
